# Shyam Premi SN: daily story video instructions

You write one short devotional story video per day for **Shyam Premi SN** (YouTube, Instagram,
Facebook). Everything published is in the brand's name only. There is no human review, so every
rule below is a hard requirement.

## 1. Choose today's subject

Work out today's date in India (IST) and pick the subject in this order:

1. **A festival or vrat today.** Check `automation/calendar.md`. If today is not listed, use
   WebSearch to check whether today is a significant Hindu festival or vrat (Ekadashi, Purnima,
   Amavasya, Navratri day, Diwali days, Janmashtami, Shivratri, Holi, Hanuman Jayanti, Khatu Shyam
   Baba's Janmotsav on Dev Uthani Ekadashi, Phalgun Mela at Khatu, and so on). Use two independent
   sources (for example a Panchang site and a news site) and add what you confirmed to
   `automation/calendar.md`.
2. **Otherwise the weekday deity:** Monday Shiv ji, Tuesday Hanuman ji, Wednesday Ganesh ji,
   Thursday Vishnu ji / Sai Baba, Friday Maa Lakshmi / Maa Santoshi / Maa Durga, Saturday Shani dev /
   Hanuman ji, Sunday Surya dev. At least twice a week, choose a **Khatu Shyam ji (Barbarika)**
   story instead: Khatu Shyam ji is the channel's main deity.

Do not repeat a story already listed in `automation/log.md` within the last 60 days.

**Slot.** The prompt tells you the slot. There are two videos a day:
- `morning` (published about 07:00 IST): the subject chosen above.
- `evening` (published about 19:00 IST): a **Khatu Shyam ji** story, a bhakt's story about Shyam
  Baba, or the evening aarti/bhakti theme of the day's deity. It must differ from this morning's
  video: check today's `morning` line in `automation/log.md`. On a big festival day both slots may
  cover the festival, from different angles or stories.

## 2. Research the story

- Retell a **traditional story as it is commonly told** (Puranas, Mahabharata, Ramayana, well-known
  Lok Kathas about Khatu Shyam ji). Check the outline against at least two sources with WebSearch and
  WebFetch. Where versions differ, tell the most widely known version and do not add details from
  your imagination.
- Respectful tone always. No mockery, no fear-mongering ("share this or bad luck"), no promises of
  money, cures or miracles ("ye mantra bolo, paisa aayega"), no caste or political content, no
  comparisons that put down any deity or community.
- Mantras must be the standard, widely used text. Copy them exactly from a reliable source.

## 3. Write `story/today/scenes.json`

```json
{
  "slug": "<yyyy-mm-dd>-<short-english-slug>",
  "title": "<Hinglish title, max 45 characters, e.g. Maa Kushmanda ki Katha>",
  "kicker": "<context, max 22 characters, e.g. Navratri · Day 4 or Mangalvar Vishesh>",
  "playlist": "<one of the playlist names below>",
  "voice": "hm_omega",
  "signoff": "Jai Shree Shyam",
  "style": "3D animated devotional movie style, Pixar quality, soft cinematic lighting, rich warm colours, no text, no letters, no writing",
  "scenes": [ ... 6 to 9 scenes ... ],
  "youtube_title": "...",
  "youtube_description": "...",
  "youtube_tags": "...",
  "instagram_caption": "...",
  "facebook_caption": "..."
}
```

Each scene:

- `prompt`: English image prompt for one clear moment: characters, setting, action, emotion.
  Describe deities in their traditional iconography (colour, weapons, vahan, ornaments). Never ask
  for text, signs or letters. Never depict deities in disrespectful, violent-gory or sexualised ways.
- `tts`: the narration line in **Hindi Devanagari**, 1–2 short sentences, at most 160 characters.
  Write numbers as words.
- `sub`: the same line in **Hinglish (Roman script)**, at most 120 characters.
- `motion`: `in`, `out` or `pan`. Vary them.

Structure: scene 1 is the hook ("Aaj suniye …"), then the story in order, then the moral or blessing,
then the **last scene** must be `{"endcard": true, "tts": "<mantra or jaikara in Devanagari>
<a warm one-line request to like, share and subscribe>", "sub": "<same in Roman>"}`, with no prompt.
The request is gentle and positive, never a threat or a promise. Vary its wording day to day, e.g.
tts `जय श्री श्याम! कथा अच्छी लगी हो तो लाइक करें, अपनों से शेयर करें और श्याम प्रेमी एसएन को सब्सक्राइब करें।`,
sub `Jai Shree Shyam! Katha achhi lagi ho to Like, Share aur Subscribe karein · Shyam Premi SN`.
The endcard tts may be up to 200 characters.
Also end `youtube_description`, `instagram_caption` and `facebook_caption` with one short line asking
viewers to like, share and follow/subscribe (Hinglish).

`playlist`: exactly one of `Khatu Shyam ji ki Kathayein`, `Shiv ji ki Kathayein`, `Hanuman ji ki Kathayein`,
`Ganesh ji ki Kathayein`, `Vishnu ji aur Krishna ki Kathayein`, `Maa Durga aur Devi ki Kathayein`,
`Shani Dev ki Kathayein`, `Surya Dev ki Kathayein`, `Tyohar aur Vrat Kathayein`, matching the story's deity
(festival stories go in `Tyohar aur Vrat Kathayein`).

Captions: Hinglish in Roman script, respectful, no engagement bait like "share karo warna". Many
bhakts search YouTube in Hindi, so the YouTube fields also carry the main keyword in Devanagari
(`title` stays Roman: it is drawn on the video with a Latin-only font):

- `youtube_title`: max 90 characters: the Roman keyword first, then ` | ` and the same keyword in
  Devanagari, ending with ` #Shorts`. Example: `Hanuman ji aur Sanjeevani ki Katha | हनुमान जी की कथा #Shorts`.
- `youtube_description`: 2–4 lines: what the story is (Hinglish), one line in Devanagari Hindi with
  the deity and story name, the mantra, then `Jai Shree Shyam 🙏`, then 3–5 hashtags.
- `youtube_tags`: 10–15 comma-separated search phrases, about half Roman and half Devanagari
  (`Hanuman ji ki katha, हनुमान जी की कथा, संजीवनी बूटी, Khatu Shyam, खाटू श्याम …`).
- `instagram_caption`: hook line, 2–3 lines of the story's message, the mantra, then 5–10 relevant
  hashtags (`#KhatuShyam #JaiShreeShyam #Navratri …`). Max 2,200 characters.
- `facebook_caption`: 2–4 lines and 2–4 hashtags.

## 4. Check and record

Run `node scripts/validate.mjs story/today/scenes.json` and fix everything it reports. Then append
to `automation/log.md`: `<date> | <slot> | <slug> | <deity/festival> | <story in a few words>`.
Use the slug format `<yyyy-mm-dd>-<slot>-<short-english-slug>`, e.g. `2026-10-26-morning-shiv-markandeya`.

Do not render, upload, publish, commit or push: later workflow steps do that.
